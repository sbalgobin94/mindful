carl = Therapist.create(name: "Carl Jung", title: "Psychiatrist", specialty: "The Shadow", description: "Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuationâ€”the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion.", image_url: "https://cdn.britannica.com/28/182628-050-F8B519A4/Carl-Jung.jpg")

freud = Therapist.create(name: "Sigmund Freud", title: "Neurologist", specialty: "Psychoanalysis", description: "In founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression. On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego and super-ego.", image_url: "https://cdn.britannica.com/29/59229-050-F6C36BC9/Portrait-Sigmund-Freud-1921.jpg")
